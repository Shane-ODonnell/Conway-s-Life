Welcome to conways game of life
I'm gonna assume you already know this very well known coding exercise if youre reading this, you just want to know how to use mine.

FUNCTIONS

left click a dead cell to bring it to life, left click a live cell to kill it
basically left click to toggle the state of a cell

you can type lowercase 'r' to bring a random number of cells to life in random locations
this random function will not kill cells, just add a random assortment of live ones

type lowercase 'c' to clear the board, killing all cells.

type 's' to start or stop the simulation at any time.
the simulation is stopped by default,
clearing the board will also stop the simulation to allow time to set up the board however it is you would like

this is my first ever readme file so I dont really know the culture of how these usally read, 
but I hope this explains how you can use this programm to simulate conways life.
